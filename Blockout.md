When making the blockout I really wanted to focus on making rooms that weren't that grand kinda medium sized or the size I think they would be in real life while obviously making the grander rooms pretty sizeable. For the prototype colors I just stuck with white for the walls, dark blue for the floors,and dark green for the actual objects that are in the rooms. Those colors all came from the prototype wad that comes with trenchbroom the only thing I really added was the sky texture that came from a wad named knave and I used it because I really liked it and thought it fit the theme of the map well.
