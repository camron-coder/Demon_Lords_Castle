Above is a video that goes through some of the iterating I did on my map. Some of those changes include changing the amount of eneimes that are set in a specfic area, changing the behavior of certain eneimes so that the player isn't swarmed and overwhemled, adding more pickups so that certain fights can be more manageable, etc..

Here are some of the areas where some changes needed to be made such as, decreaseing the amount of eneimes incountered in these rooms and also adding more pickups in the rooms so that the player has a better chance of surviving.
