# Areas of the demon lords castle

When coming up with ideas on how exactly I would like to make the demon lords castle I had a few immediate ideas for some areas in the castle such as..

## 1)The ballroom

### Narrative 
What every castle needs is an area where it can host a large some of people for various reasons and just because hes a demon lord it doesn't mean he does not enjoy partying. Thats where the ballroom comes into play, located on the second floor next to a couple other rooms that we will get into later. This large and decorated space will be great a hack and slash event.

### Gameplay
Since the ballroom will be a really open area with lots of room to run around, this area will be populated with lots of kights and a couple grunts. I want the player to be constantly moving in this area because thats what a ballroom is meant for.


## 2)Kitchen

### Narrative 
Everyone needs food to survive even the demon lord. So he emplyed one his top orge's to be his chef and with the help of a couple grunts he's able to prepare some of the evil delicacies you've ever tasted. Just don't touch the meat locker!

### Gameplay
This will look like a standard kitchen but with some bodies hanging here and there . Then theres the head chef that is of course a orge and these guys are quite tanky so I will leave plently of room for the player to move around so that they dont get trapped and die.
