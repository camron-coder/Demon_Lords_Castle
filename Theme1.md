# Theme

So when first starting this project i had to come up with a theme since thats the ultimate building force when creating a map. My first thought was to try and continue with my church map but i wanted to do something a little different. That's why this map will be about escaping a demon lords castle. There are tons of WADs that depict demons or just have a really demonic feel to them so it wasn't that hard to find the textures i would need, here are a couple examples below.

Here are a couple questions i asked myself while coming up ideas for my map.  
1)Where is this place in the world? - I want the player to think they are in a very evil a demonic area and that they have no hope of escaping here.  
2)What is about to happen?- The player is going to be sentenced to death but at the last minute something will happen and they will have the opertuinty to escape.  
3)What should the player be on the lookout for?- They're going to be in a castle so there will be lots of rooms so i think the player should explore all of the rooms because you never know what you will find.  
4)Whoâ€™s really in control here? - There will of course be a fight with the demon lord i just dont know who that will be yet.  
5)What here is powerful or valuable?- There will be a wide range of weapons for the player to use they just need to explore to find them.
