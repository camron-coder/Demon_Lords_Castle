# Lighting and Textures

### Lighting and Textures process breakdown
-------------
I was actually recently able to get my lights working as before they just didn't want to work and my maps just stayed really bright the whole time but after some troubleshooting I was finally able to get them to work! So when working on my map it my first time actually working with lighting and I think overall it turned out good some dark spots here and there but what castle doesn't have some dark spots. Since this was my first time trying the lights im sure there's some stuff I missed and got wrong such as the color property of the light boxes, that didn't really work for me the light wou;d just stay white. The textures were also a bit of a challenge in some places but I overall enjoyed downloading all the different wad files to use. I did run into problems with like walls that were connected to 2 different rooms that didn't have similar themes to them but I just had to make sure that I was selecting th face of the wall I wanted to change the texture on it.

Here we see the starting area and I probably should've made it darker since you are getting carted off to prision but I think seeing where your going can also be a bit scary.

Next we see the hallway that the players see when they breakout. I again didn't want to go to dark because the guards do live in this wing of the castle and they to need to see so I wanted to go for a gloomy atmosphere.

Lastly we have the fancy dining hall. This is where the grand demon lord himself likes to eat so but even he likes a little mood lighting so I didn't want this area to be to dark or to light. But this is still a demons castle so I left the roof with this really ominous shadow to it.
